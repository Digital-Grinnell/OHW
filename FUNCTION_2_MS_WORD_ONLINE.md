# Function 2: Transcribe with MS Word Online

## Purpose
Provide step-by-step instructions for manual transcription using Microsoft Word Online's built-in Transcribe feature, using Microsoft's cloud-based transcription service.

> **Note:** MS Word Online is the only transcription method in OHM. OpenAI Whisper was evaluated and implemented as an automated local transcription option but was permanently removed due to licensing concerns with the model and lack of built-in speaker diarization capabilities.

## Requirements
- **Microsoft 365 subscription** - Required for Word Online transcription feature
- **Supported audio file** - Select an MP3, WAV, M4A, or MP4 file. Function 2 uses a standardized MP3 in the output directory when one exists; otherwise it can transcribe the selected supported source directly.
- **Internet connection** - Transcription happens in the cloud
- **Modern web browser** - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge

## When to Use This Function

Use MS Word Online transcription when:
- You have a Microsoft 365 subscription
- You want to use Word's built-in speaker identification
- You're comfortable with Word Online's interface

## Usage

1. In the **Inputs** section, click **Browse...** to select a directory containing your audio files
3. Click **Rescan** to scan the directory and all subdirectories for recognized audio files
4. From the **Select Audio File** dropdown, choose the audio file you want to transcribe
5. **(Optional)** Enter names in the **Individuals** panel
   - **Interviewer** — defaults to "Interviewer" if left blank
   - **Speaker 1–4** — the oral history subject(s)
   - **Reviewed By** — reviewer/editor name (omitted from narrative if blank)
   - Names are displayed in the instructions dialog and applied during DOCX-to-JSON conversion
   - Stored with normalised keys: `Interviewer`, `Speaker 1` … `Speaker 4`, `Reviewed By`
6. In the **Active Functions** dropdown, select **"2: Transcribe with Selected Mode"**
7. A dialog will appear with two tabs:
   - **📝 MS Word Instructions** — the step-by-step transcription workflow (default view)
   - **📋 Review Notes** — an inline Markdown editor for recording changes and observations
8. Follow the instructions to complete the transcription process
9. Switch to the **Review Notes** tab at any time to jot down notes; click **Save Notes** to persist them

## Transcription Workflow

The function displays instructions for this multi-step workflow:

### STEP 1: Open Microsoft Word Online
- Navigate to https://word.cloud.microsoft
- Sign in with your Microsoft 365 account
- Click 'Create Blank Document'

### STEP 2: Set Document Name
- Click on 'Document X', or whatever name is given to the new document, near the top left corner of the Word window
- Replace it with the name of your audio file (without extension)
- Press Enter to confirm

### STEP 3: Start Transcription
- Access the Transcribe feature (Home tab → Dictate dropdown → Transcribe)
- Upload your MP3 file
- Wait for Microsoft's service to process the audio
- Processing time varies by file length (typically a few minutes)

### STEP 4: Review & Edit
- Review the transcription in the Transcribe pane
- Edit speaker names (replace "Speaker 1" with actual names)
- Fix any transcription errors
- **💡 Use the Review Notes tab in the dialog to record significant changes you make to the Word-generated transcript. Remember to SAVE your notes.**
- **⚠️  CRITICAL: Click 'Add to document' → select 'With Speakers and Timestamps'**
  - This option is required to preserve speaker labels and timestamps in the DOCX file
  - Using plain 'Add to document' (without speakers/timestamps) will produce a file the converter cannot parse correctly

### STEP 5: Save as DOCX
Save the DOCX directly to your output directory — no moving needed.

Before you begin the download, copy these two values from the instructions dialog:
- **Save To (Output Directory):** shown as a copyable field in the dialog — the full path to `~/OHM-data/<sanitized-basename>--dg_<epoch>/`
- **Save As (Filename):** shown as a copyable field in the dialog — e.g. `dg_<epoch>.docx`

Then:
- Click the **File** menu in Word
- Select **Create a Copy**
- Select **Download a copy** and confirm
- When the browser's Save dialog appears, navigate to the **Output Directory** path above, set the filename to the **Save As** value, and click **Save**

> **If your browser saves automatically to Downloads** (no Save dialog): move the file
> from Downloads to the output directory and rename it to match the expected filename
> before clicking **Convert to JSON**.

### STEP 6: Convert to JSON
- Once the DOCX is in the output directory with the correct filename, click the **"Convert to JSON"** button
- The function will automatically:
  - Parse the DOCX transcription file
  - Extract timestamps and speaker labels from Word's format
  - Map Word's speakers to your custom speaker names (in order of appearance)
  - Create a JSON transcript file
- **Speaker Name Mapping:**
  - 1st speaker in Word → 1st name in Speaker Names fields
  - 2nd speaker in Word → 2nd name in Speaker Names fields
  - etc.
  - Names are used exactly as entered (case and spaces preserved)
- File created:
  - `dg_<epoch>_transcript.json` - JSON transcript with your speaker names

**Note:** The conversion expects Word's transcription format with timestamps like `00:00:00 Speaker` and text on following lines.

### STEP 7: Generate Final Outputs
- After conversion completes, use **Function 4** to generate TXT, VTT, and PDF outputs from the JSON

## Output Directory

The instructions remind you to save files in:
```
~/OHM-data/<sanitized-basename>--dg_<epoch>/
```

This is the same directory used by all other functions for consistency.

## Review Notes Integration

The Function 2 dialog includes a built-in **Review Notes** tab so you can record observations without switching away from the transcription instructions.

- The tab opens the same `review_notes.md` file used by Function 3
- If the file already exists its current content is loaded; otherwise a dated starter template is pre-filled
- Click **Save Notes** inside the tab to write the file at any time
- Changes saved here are immediately visible if you later open Function 3, and vice versa
- The file is stored alongside all other per-file outputs:
  ```
  ~/OHM-data/<sanitized-basename>--dg_<epoch>/review_notes.md
  ```

## Important Notes

### Microsoft 365 Subscription Required
- The Transcribe feature is only available with a Microsoft 365 subscription
- Free Word Online accounts cannot access this feature
- Check your subscription status before attempting transcription

### Automated Conversion
- The **"Convert to JSON"** button eliminates manual JSON creation
- Automatically parses Word's transcription format
- Maps speakers to your custom names from the Speaker Names fields
- Preserves exact name formatting (no automatic uppercase or underscores)
- Creates JSON transcript instantly

### Manual JSON Creation No Longer Required
- Previous versions required manually extracting and formatting JSON
- The automated conversion button handles this automatically
- Save the DOCX directly to the output directory during download (path and filename shown in the dialog), then click the button

### Data Privacy
- Your audio file is uploaded to Microsoft's servers for processing
- Microsoft may retain your data according to their privacy policy

### File Organization
- Keep all files for one interview in the same output directory
- Use the exact filenames shown in the instructions
- This ensures Function 4 can find the JSON file when generating outputs

## Common Issues

### Transcribe Feature Not Available
**Problem**: The Transcribe option doesn't appear in Word Online  
**Solution**: This feature requires a Microsoft 365 subscription. Check your account status.

### Upload Fails
**Problem**: Audio file won't upload to Word Online  
**Solution**:
- Check file size - Word Online has upload limits
- If upload issues occur, try creating a standardized MP3 with Function 1 first
- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page

### Transcription Quality Issues
**Problem**: Transcription has many errors  
**Solution**:
- Check audio quality (reduce background noise)
- Ensure clear speech without excessive overlap
- Edit the transcription manually in Word before saving

### JSON Formatting Errors
**Problem**: Function 4 fails to read your JSON  
**Solution**:
- Use a JSON validator (jsonlint.com) to check formatting
- Ensure all strings are in quotes
- Check for proper comma placement
- Don't include trailing commas
- Match the example structure exactly

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Use good audio quality** - Clear speech, minimal background noise
2. **Edit in Word** - Fix all errors before saving the DOCX
3. **Be precise with names** - Ensure consistent speaker naming
4. **Validate JSON** - Use an online JSON validator before using Function 4
5. **Save incrementally** - Don't lose work if browser crashes

## Expected Results

After completing all steps:
- DOCX file in output directory with corrected transcript
- JSON file with properly formatted segments and speaker labels
- Ready to run Function 4 to generate TXT and VTT outputs
